# T3-Portfolio

For this challenge We needed to create a portfolio with work samples to submit to future employers for review. 

Acceptance Criteria: 
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

*Notes for reviewer/grader
- About me section has placeholder text for now, will update later. 
- This one was more challenging than the first. I tries my best to satistfy the acceptance criteria. My biggest challenge for this assignment was the media queries. I hope to gain more experience over the course of this bootcamp and will update my portfolio as I progress.
